Intended to download races from <https://eurovisionsport.com/explore/sport?id=EBU-Home-Biathlon>, but it turns out that `node-hls-downloader` doesn't seem to be able to handle that, and maybe <https://biathlon.io/> [is working on](https://www.reddit.com/r/biathlon/comments/18zi91g/eurovision_sports_streams_for_oberhof/kgzuvhu/) something?
